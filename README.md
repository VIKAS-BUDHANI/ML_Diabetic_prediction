Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.
## Health impact
* Adults with diabetes have a two- to three-fold increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.
* Combined with reduced blood flow, neuropathy (nerve damage) in the feet increases the chance of foot ulcers, infection and eventual need for limb amputation.
* Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness and occurs as a result of long-term accumulated damage to the small blood vessels in the retina. Close to 1 million people are blind due to diabetes.
* Diabetes is among the leading causes of kidney failure.
* People with diabetes are more likely to have poor outcomes for several infectious diseases, including COVID-19.

## Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques.

## Dataset contains
The dataset contains of several medical predictors variables and one target varaible.
various variable contain
* Pregnancies
* Glucose
* BloodPressure
* SkinThickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age

## Result 
The algorithm used for this model is Logistic Regression and the accuracy of model is 76 %.
