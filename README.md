Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.

## Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques.

## Dataset contains
The dataset contains of several medical predictors variables and one target varaible.
various variable contain
* Pregnancies
* Glucose
* BloodPressure
* SkinThickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age

### Tech stack: Python and its library, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,etc.

## Step for creating the Project
* Collected the data from Kaggle.
* Performed data pre-processing, data standardization,and training the data.
* The algorithm used -Logistic regression, K Neighbours classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, Decision Tree, 
  support vector machine , and Random forest and evaluate the model.
* With the best performing model, I have made a web page
  and app in a local host.
 
## Model with there accuracy. I have chosen the Random Forest Model for my project.
* Accuracy score of Logistic Regression: 76.04
* Accuracy score of KNN: 73.44
* Accuracy score of Naive Bayes: 72.4
* Accuracy score of SVM: 74.48
* Accuracy score of Decision Tree: 68.75
* Accuracy score of Random Forest: 73.96

## Steps to run the model
* First Download the resposiory and open in you VScode or pycharm etc.
* Install the python libraries from (requirements.txt) file.
* Run you VS terminal and  type the directory (cd .\app\) run the code.
* After opeing app directory  run the app file -------  (python .\app.py)
* It will host the application on you local host.
* Click the host link and check the application.
